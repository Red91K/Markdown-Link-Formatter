# Markdown-Link-Formatter
A Python script that converts links to websites &amp; images into a markdown-compatible-format.
I made it because it was annoying to put multiple links into markdown format, especially when the title of the website mattered

- You can enter multiple links at a time
- Enter the link, and the script will automatically grab the title and detect if it is an image or website
- The script automatically copies the output to the clipboard.
